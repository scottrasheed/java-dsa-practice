### Question 1:
**Answer:** A) True

**Explanation:**  
Pushing onto a stack only involves creating a new node and updating a pointer.  
Thereâ€™s no searching or traversing involved, making it a **constant-time (O(1))** operation.

### Question 2:
**Answer:** A) True

**Explanation:**  
In a properly designed queue (with a head pointer), removing the front item is a **simple pointer update**.  
No need to loop through the queue â€” itâ€™s a **constant-time (O(1))** operation.

### Question 3:
**Answer:** A) True

**Explanation:**  
Itâ€™s common to implement a stack with an ArrayList because adding/removing from the end of an ArrayList is **fast (O(1))** on average.  
The last element naturally acts as the **top of the stack**, making ArrayList a convenient choice.
