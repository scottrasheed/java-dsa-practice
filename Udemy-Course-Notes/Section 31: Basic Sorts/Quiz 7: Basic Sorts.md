### **Question 1:**  
**What is the average-case time complexity of Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sort?**

A. O(n)  
B. O(log n)  
C. O(nÂ²)  
D. O(n log n)

**âœ… Correct Answer: C. O(nÂ²)**  
Each of these sorting algorithms uses nested loops, making the average time complexity O(nÂ²).

### **Question 2:**  
**What is the space complexity of Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sort?**

A. O(n)  
B. O(log n)  
C. O(nÂ²)  
D. O(1)  

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

**âœ… Correct Answer: D. O(1)**  
They all sort the array in place without needing extra memory, so their space complexity is constant: O(1).

### **Question 3:**  
**Which sorting algorithm has O(n) time complexity when the input is already sorted or nearly sorted?**

A. Bubble Sort  
B. Selection Sort  
C. Insertion Sort  
D. All of the above  

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

**âœ… Correct Answer: C. Insertion Sort**  
Only Insertion Sort can achieve O(n) time complexity in the best case (when the array is already sorted).
