### Understanding O(log n) with an Example

In my current lesson, I'm learning about **Big O notation**, specifically **O(log n)**, which represents logarithmic time complexity. This happens when an algorithm reduces a problem in size by a constant factor with each step, typically halving it.

To break it down using \( 2^3 = 8 \) and \( \log_2(8) = 3 \):

#### Breaking Down \( 2^3 = 8 \):
- When I write `2^3 = 8`, I’m saying that 2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8.
- Logarithms are the reverse of exponentiation. So, if I want to know what exponent (in this case, 3) I must raise 2 to in order to get 8, I can express it as `log₂(8)`.

#### Understanding \( \log_2(8) = 3 \):
- `log₂(8) = 3` means: "What power should I raise 2 to in order to get 8?"
- The answer is 3 because `2^3 = 8`.

#### Relating This to Big O (O(log n)):
- In Big O, **log n** tells me how many steps it would take to reduce the size of a problem. The algorithm typically divides the problem in half each time.
- For example, if I’m halving a search space (like in binary search), the number of operations it takes to reduce the problem to a manageable size is logarithmic. For a problem size of 8, it would take 3 steps (because `log₂(8) = 3`).

#### Why O(log n) is Efficient:
- The reason O(log n) is considered efficient is that it grows much slower than linear time (O(n)). If I have a list of 8 elements, I only need 3 steps (since `log₂(8) = 3`), but if I had 1,000 elements, it would only take about 10 steps (since `log₂(1000) ≈ 10`).

This is a key concept in algorithms like binary search, where each step cuts the problem size in half, and the number of operations grows logarithmically as the size of the input increases.
